# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Overview

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played between a dealer and one or more players. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The dealer must follow specific rules for drawing additional cards.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Tkinter for a smooth user experience.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Implemented core rules of Blackjack, including hitting, standing, and dealer behavior.
- **Card Graphics**: Visual representation of cards for an immersive gameplay experience.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of player scores and the dealer's hand.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the game logic.
- **Tkinter**: GUI toolkit for creating the game interface.

## Getting Started

To run the Blackjack game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MisbahAN/Blackjack.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd Blackjack
    ```

3. **Run the game**:
    ```sh

## Future Enhancements

- Add multiplayer functionality for playing against multiple players.
