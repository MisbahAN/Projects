# Projects

Welcome to my Projects repository! This is where I work on various projects to apply and expand my skills in programming and web development. As I learn new technologies, I aim to create meaningful and fun projects, documenting my progress along the way.

## Technologies

Here are the technologies I have learned or am currently learning:

- **Python**: General-purpose scripting, data analysis, automation, and more.
- **Tkinter**: Building simple GUI applications in Python.
- **HTML & CSS** (In Progress): Structuring and styling web pages for a better visual experience.
- **JavaScript** (Coming Soon): Adding interactivity to web pages and enhancing user experience.
- **Flask** (Coming Soon): Creating dynamic web applications using Python.
- **Django** (Coming Soon): Developing robust and scalable web applications.
- **Node.js** (Coming Soon): Building server-side applications and APIs with JavaScript for scalable backend services.

## Structure

This repository is organized by projects, each with its own folder. Each folder includes the project code, relevant resources, and documentation (if needed).

## Current Projects

### 1. Python & Tkinter Projects
These projects demonstrate the use of Python for scripting and GUI application development using Tkinter.

### 2. Web Development Projects
Projects focusing on front-end technologies like HTML and CSS, with future plans for integrating JavaScript, Flask, and Django for the backend, as well as building server-side applications using Node.js.

## Goals
- Apply my learning to create real-world projects.
- Improve my problem-solving and development skills.
- Learn new tools and technologies by building practical applications.
- Share my progress and document my learning journey.

## Future Plans
- Build interactive websites using JavaScript.
- Create backend services with Flask, Django, and Node.js.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
